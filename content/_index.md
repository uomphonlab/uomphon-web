# Phonetics Laboratory | University of Manchester

The **University of Manchester’s Phonetics Laboratory** (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">aka</span> the **Phon Lab**) is the research hub for work in acoustic and articulatory phonetics, experimental phonology and socio-phonetics at the University of Manchester. The Lab is used by staff and PhD students alike as well as undergraduate- and master's-level dissertation writers and research assistants from the Department of Linguistics and English Language (LEL).

Located in room **S1.24** of the **Samuel Alexander Building**, the Lab consists of 3 rooms for recording and analysing speech data. Its facilities include a sound-attenuated recording booth, audio and articulatory equipment, as well as several desktop and laptop computers for running experiments and analysing phonetic data. We also have a store with equipment that can be used and borrowed by staff and students conducting research and working on assignments in LEL. See our **[Facilities]({{< ref "facilities.md" >}})** page for more information.

If you would like to book the recording booth or borrow any equipment, please check availability on the **[Schedule]({{< ref "schedule.md" >}})** and then get in contact with the lab assistants through the **[Contact]({{< ref "contact.md" >}})** page.

The university also has a separate **[Psycholinguistics Lab](https://uompsylinglab.github.io/)** that you might also be interested in.
